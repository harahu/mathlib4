# Submonoids of Archimedean monoids

This file defines the instances that show that the (mul-)Archimedean property is retained in a
submonoid of the ambient group.

## Main statements

* `SubmonoidClass.instMulArchimedean`: the submonoid (and similar subobjects) of a mul-Archimedean
  group retains the mul-Archimedean property when restricted to the submonoid.
* `AddSubmonoidClass.instArchimedean`: the additive submonoid (and similar subobjects) of an
  Archimedean additive group retains the Archimedean property when restricted to the additive
  submonoid.
